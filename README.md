## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As an undergraduate student, I am learning C++, Rust and so on. I love learning Computer Science knowledge and English, also love playing games like [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) and [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com).

I also think highly of personal privacies, so I hate maliciously collecting (or also personally called "stealing") personal data without explicitly inform users in advanced. I hope every countries and territories can reinforce their strategies to store and manage personal data to prevent users from being "bared" on the Internet, like the GDPR the EU made.

A typical case that maliciously collect personal data is delete Wenjuanxing's account. They require users provide their real name and ID number to delete their accounts. Here is the original website of this requirement that is written in Chinese (you might need a translator to browse this website): [The Process of Deleting Wenjuanxing's Account](https://www.wjx.cn/help/help.aspx?helpid=413).

So, with my statements above, softwares I developed will never collect any of your data. All personal data produced will be locally stored and encrypted on your device.

I hope everyone can enjoy the life and be energetic everyday!

Well, you can contact me by using English or Chinese. Hope we will have pleasure conversations.ðŸ˜Š
