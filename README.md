### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate student who is learning C++, Rust and so on. I love learning Computer Science knowledge and English, also love playing games like [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) and [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com).

Recently I am planning writting a Minecraft Launcher which is written in Rust as a challenge for me. I dreamed about writting something funny in the future.

I hope everyone can enjoy the life and be energetic everyday!

Well, you can contact with me by using English or Chinese. Hope we will have pleasure conversations.ðŸ˜Š

### The programming languages I am learning and using:
